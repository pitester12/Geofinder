How to put in longitude and latitude and reseve an address

how to install: (Kali linux, Mint linux, Ubuntu and Debian linux)

sudo apt install pip && sudo pip install geopy && git clone https://github.com/pitester12/pitester12

how to run:
cd pitester12 && python3 geofinder.py

that should work!
put in your longitude then latitude and it will find the address
also, If you were to type in a place that does not speak english, it will NOT translate it
you will have to use bing translate or google translate to see what it says

by the way the scipt WILL NOT work if there is no wifi or you can modify the code to run offline
